LiveVote
==================

An app for organizing live votes for parties, conferences, meetings and competitions.

It can take a collection of items to vote on, then people vote on them in pairs. The items face against each other and the winner progresses.

There are two sets of UI, one for voting which could be on anything with a web browser, and the result which could be beamed onto a projector, for example.
